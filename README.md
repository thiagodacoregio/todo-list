For my first project in JavaScript, I created a functional and interactive to-do list application. The project allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete, providing a simple yet effective tool for organizing daily activities. I focused on building a clean and intuitive user interface and learned a lot about JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and local storage to save tasks between sessions. This project marks a big milestone for me, and I'm thrilled to have it published and ready for others to use!
